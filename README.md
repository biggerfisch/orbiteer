# Orbiteer

A tool to control time-range based scripts

# Goals

1. Provide a consistent, elegant way of running a script repeatedly with varied time inputs in a useful way, such as fitting a goal run-time.
2. Provide clear error handling and notification, failing gracefully.
3. Be highly configurable.
4. Be highly tested.
